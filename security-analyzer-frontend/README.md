## Backend Integration

This frontend connects to your n8n workflow endpoint:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/log`
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**: `{ "log": "your-security-event-data" }`

The expected response format from your n8n workflow:
```json
{
  "threat_score": 7,
  "cause": "Suspicious login attempt detected",
  "remedy": "Block IP address and reset user credentials",
  "mitre_att&ck_url": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/",
  "mitre_technique": "Valid Accounts",
  "approach": ["Monitor login patterns", "Implement MFA", "Review access logs"]
}
```

## Development Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run dev` - Start development server and open browser

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues**: Make sure your n8n instance allows requests from `http://localhost:3000`
- **Connection Errors**: Verify your n8n workflow is running on port 5678
- **API Errors**: Check the browser console for detailed error messages
